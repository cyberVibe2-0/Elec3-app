These tests are used to determine if the boost is present
and if it is of version 1.54 or not. The point is that
1.54 boost has a bug that prevents Fritzing from working properly.

See file [1] and site [2] to find out how these tests are used.
More interesting is WHY are they used. This is because boost
doesn't create .pc file when installed, so its presence can not
be detected by pkg-config as it is done for libgit2.
